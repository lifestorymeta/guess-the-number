# 🎯 Guess the Number Game

This is a fun Python terminal game where the computer picks a number between 1 and 100 — and your job is to guess it! The game also tracks your **high score** (fewest guesses) using a text file.

---

## 💡 How to Play

1. **Run the `guess_the_number.py` file to start the game.**

2. Enter your guesses when prompted.
   
3. The game will give hints:

🔻 Lower number please!

🔺 Higher number please!

4. Keep guessing until you get it right.

5. If you beat your best score, it will save your new high score in High_score.txt.
