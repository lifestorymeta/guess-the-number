# ðŸŽ¯ Guess the Number Game

This is a fun Python terminal game where the computer picks a number between 1 and 100 â€” and your job is to guess it! The game also tracks your **high score** (fewest guesses) using a text file.

---

## ðŸ’¡ How to Play

1. Run the game using Python:

```bash
python guess_the_number.py
```
2. Enter your guesses when prompted.
   
3. The game will give hints:

ðŸ”» Lower number please!

ðŸ”º Higher number please!

4. Keep guessing until you get it right.

5. If you beat your best score, it will save your new high score in High_score.txt.
